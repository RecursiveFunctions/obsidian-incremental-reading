/**
 * The review loop: find what is due, show it one element at a time, and
 * reschedule it.
 *
 * Source of truth is the plugin-owned store (Option 1, docs/DESIGN.md): the
 * queue is built from the folded event log, and every review action appends
 * an event. Frontmatter is *also* written on each action so the migration
 * fallback stays intact and a user can still read state in the note until
 * cutover is confirmed; nothing here ever reads frontmatter to decide the
 * queue.
 *
 * Two element classes, two models, matching SuperMemo:
 *
 *  - Items (cloze) are *recall tested*. Reveal the answer, then grade
 *    Again/Hard/Good/Easy; FSRS reschedules from the grade.
 *  - Topics and extracts are *read*, never graded. You press Next and the
 *    topic schedule stretches the interval by its A-Factor. "Later today"
 *    postpones without advancing; Dismiss holds it out of the queue.
 *
 * Priority (the SuperMemo 0-100 percentile that orders the queue) is editable
 * inline on every element, since reordering is a constant part of the flow.
 *
 * In-place editing and child-note creation are also first-class: topics and
 * extracts open as rendered markdown; **Edit** swaps in a textarea over the
 * preview. Text can be selected in either mode for extract/cloze (preview
 * selection maps back to the markdown source when possible), and edits
 * auto-save when the card advances. For cloze items, edit/extract/cloze are
 * gated until the answer is revealed, because the raw body is the answer.
