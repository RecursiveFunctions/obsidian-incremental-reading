## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Review UI** (MVP item 5): command and ribbon *"Start IR review"* open a modal that walks every due IR note, ordered by priority then due date. Cloze answers stay hidden until `Space`; `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` grade Again/Hard/Good/Easy. Each grade runs the card through FSRS and writes the rescheduled state back to frontmatter. Adds `schedule()` to the FSRS layer and `src/review.ts`.
- **Cloze from selection** (MVP item 4): command *"Cloze selection into an IR item"* and an editor context-menu action. The selected span becomes the hidden answer in a `{{c1::...}}` cloze; the full lines it spans are kept as context. Creates a child `ir-type: item` note linked to its source.
- SuperMemo-style default hotkeys: `Alt+X` extract, `Alt+Z` cloze. Rebindable in Settings, Hotkeys.
- **Extract from selection** (MVP item 3): command *"Extract selection to IR child note"* and an editor context-menu action. Creates a child note holding the selected text, sets `ir-type: extract` and `ir-parent`, inherits the source priority, seeds a fresh FSRS card, then opens the new note. Refuses if the source is not an IR topic or extract.
- **Topic mark** (MVP item 1): command *"Mark current note as IR topic"* and a ribbon action that set `ir-type: topic` plus `ir-priority` and seed a fresh FSRS card in note frontmatter. Re-marking an existing topic is a no-op.
- Settings tab with a configurable default topic priority (0 to 100 slider) and an optional extract folder.
- Frontmatter/FSRS serialization layer (`src/fsrs.ts`, `src/ir-note.ts`, `src/types.ts`), the shared foundation later IR features build on.
- Initial repository scaffold: Obsidian plugin skeleton, TypeScript + esbuild build pipeline, `ts-fsrs` dependency for scheduling, MIT license, CI build workflow, issue templates.
